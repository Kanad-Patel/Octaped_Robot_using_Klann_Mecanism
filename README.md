# Octaped Robot Project

## Overview
The **Octaped Robot** is a biologically inspired, eight-legged robotic platform designed for mobility, stability, and adaptability across various terrains. This project combines mechanical engineering, kinematic principles, and robotics to develop a versatile walking robot.

## Features
- **Eight-Leg Mechanism**: Based on a linkage system that replicates biological gaits for smooth movement.
- **Modular Design**: Each leg is connected to the body using a standardized linkage system, enabling easy modifications or replacements.
- **Customizable Platform**: Central flat surface for mounting sensors, payloads, or additional modules like cameras or LiDAR.
- **Low Cost**: Designed with a focus on using affordable and accessible materials, including laser-cut acrylic.
- **Kinematic Precision**: Optimized for efficient motion and reduced energy consumption.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a stable robotic platform for uneven terrains.
2. Demonstrate the feasibility of a simple yet effective eight-legged walking mechanism.
3. Serve as a foundational platform for robotics research or competitions.

## Files Included
- **CAD Model**: 
  - File name: `Octaped_Robot.f3z`
  - Format: Autodesk Fusion 360 Archive File
  - Purpose: The complete 3D design of the Octaped Robot.

- **CAD Render**: 
  - File name: `CAD.png`
  - Format: PNG Image
  - Purpose: A visual representation of the Octaped Robot CAD model.

## How It Works
The robot employs a series of linkages for each leg, connected to rotary actuators. The movement of the legs is synchronized to maintain balance and achieve locomotion. The flat platform serves as a mount for additional hardware.

### Key Components
1. **Linkage System**: Responsible for translating rotary motion into linear movement for walking.
2. **Actuators**: Electric motors (or other types) that drive the leg movements.
3. **Body Frame**: Laser-cut from 3mm acrylic sheets for a lightweight and durable structure.

## Assembly Instructions
1. **Download the CAD Model**: Open the `Octaped_Robot.f3z` file in Autodesk Fusion 360.
2. **Manufacture the Parts**:
   - Use the CAD design to create DXF files for laser cutting.
   - Laser cut the parts from 3mm acrylic sheets.
3. **Assemble the Robot**:
   - Start by constructing the frame.
   - Attach each leg mechanism to the frame using the specified screws/fasteners.
   - Ensure all linkage components are properly aligned and secured.
4. **Integrate Actuators**:
   - Mount motors or actuators to the designated locations.
   - Connect the linkages to the motor shafts.
5. **Test**:
   - Verify the leg movements manually before powering up the system.
   - Calibrate the actuators for synchronized movement.
